## Introduction

This Homework assignment was done to help improve on Horiseon's search engine optimization by the use of Semantic Elements in HTML. I also decreased load times making the page quicker to access and more professional feeling.

## Description

Some of the Semantic Elements I used the most were `section` tags in place of `div` tags. Div tags hold no semantic value and tell nothing about what they are displaying. This makes your webpage harder to read for both the browser and other developers. Section tags hwowver are semantic elements and clearly define their content. Ways I made the website quicker to load are by decreasing photo size, and combining repeated classes in css. One more user friendly touch I added to this webpage is making "seo" in H1 abbreviated. Now when users hover over the H1 tag where "seo" is located, they get an extended version which says "search engine optimization".

## Example of abbreviation

```html
<h1>
  Hori<span class="seo"
    ><abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">seo</abbr>
  </span>
  n
</h1>
```
